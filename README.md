This web app allows a student to select the courses they wish to take and then generates every possible schedule based on the available sections of that course. I built part of this project for HackClub's [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com) event.

## AI Acknowledgement

I used Claude to do some styling and build the calendar component (app/src/routes/schedule/Schedule.svelte).
